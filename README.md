# Readability prediction    


Essentially the powerpoint presentation of the implementation of the paper, 

> Kevyn Collins-Thompson, James P. Callan. "A Language Modeling Approach to Predicting Reading Difficulty"
> Proceedings of the Human Language Technology Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: HLT-NAACL 2004

Although the code is not given, I plan to add it later. The presentation is attached, which includes an introduction to machine learning and readability as well, so it might be helpful for people looking to explain the fundamentals to others.
